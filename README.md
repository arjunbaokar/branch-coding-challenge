- Put AWS credentials into a file called 'aws_credentials', where the first line is AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, and the second is AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. Nothing else should be in the file. My file is not pushed to the repo, but make sure you add in aws_credentials or it won't be able to grab the data from AWS.

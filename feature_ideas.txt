time of day of phone calls - calling at weird times of day might be bad (mod timestamp to get time in day)
total duration of phone calls - if they are on the phone a lot, they could have a good amount of capital (more expensive than texting)
number of non-number SMS addresses - these are usually sent by companies, could imply business involvement
other loans - look for word "loan" in message bodies
